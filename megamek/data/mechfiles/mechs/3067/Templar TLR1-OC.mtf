capabilities:A close combat configuration, the C configuration of the Templar carries a devastating LB-X Autocannon/20 as its primary weapon, which can fire both solid rounds and shotgun-like cluster rounds. Also for close range, the Templar C has five Medium Pulse Lasers and an ER Medium Laser, which can be used to devastating effect at short range. For long range defense, the Templar carries a single ER PPC. To add mobility to the 'Mech, it has four pod-mounted jump jets that let the Templar C jump up to one hundred and twenty meters. An additional heat sink is added to help handle the 'Mech's heat.

deployment: The Templar is built on a lightweight Kallon Type XIX Endo Steel chassis and is powered by a KalTek 340 XL engine that gives the 'Mech a top speed of 64.8 km/h while sacrificing durability. The Templar has thirteen fixed double heat sinks and is armored with sixteen and a half tons of Starshield A armor with CASE fixed in the right torso. Overall, this allows the Templar to have forty tons of free pod space for weapons and equipment which the 'Mech uses effectively in its various configurations.

history:With a noticeable lack of OmniMechs designed in the Federated Suns, Field Marshal Duke George Hasek went over the heads of the Department of the Quartermaster and commissioned Kallon Industries to design an assault OmniMech and backed the project with his own considerable financial resources. The resulting 'Mech is a force to be reckoned with on the modern battlefield.
